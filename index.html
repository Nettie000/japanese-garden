                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Japanese gardens are designed to express harmony, simplicity, and the deep connection between
                    nature and spirituality. These are not merely visual compositions — they are spaces for
                    contemplation,
                    shaped by
                    centuries of tradition.</p>

                <h2>Core Concepts & Aesthetic Principles</h2>
                <ul class="nature-elements">
                    <li class="element"><strong>Natural beauty, not artificial decoration:</strong> These gardens
                        emphasize aged
                        materials,
                        asymmetry, and organic shapes. Every element—from rocks and moss to water and plants—is
                        carefully
                        placed
                        with intention to create a natural, balanced environment.</li>

                    <li class="element"><strong>Wabi-sabi and symbolism:</strong> The aesthetic is guided by the
                        appreciation of
                        imperfection,
                        impermanence, and simplicity. Nothing is overly polished. Elements often carry symbolic
                        meaning:
                        rocks
                        may represent mountains, and white sand or gravel may symbolize water or rivers.</li>

                    <li class="element"><strong>Miniaturization and visual framing:</strong> Many gardens are small in
                        scale yet
                        designed to
                        represent vast natural landscapes. They are often meant to be viewed from specific
                        angles—similar to
                        a
                        scroll painting slowly unrolling.</li>

                    <li class="element"><strong>Miegakure</strong> ("hide and reveal") and shakkei</strong> ("borrowed
                        scenery") are
                        essential
                        principles. Miegakure uses partial concealment to guide viewers through moments of quiet
                        discovery.
                        Shakkei incorporates outside elements—like distant mountains or nearby trees—into the
                        composition,
                        blurring the boundary between the garden and its surroundings.</li>

                <h2>Elements of a Traditional Japanese Garden</h2>

                <h4>Water</h4>
                <p>Represents flow, change, and the passing of
                    time. Streams, ponds, and waterfalls are central elements in many gardens. In dry landscapes, raked
                    gravel takes the place of water while maintaining its symbolic role.</p>
                <h4>Rocks and gravel</h4>
                <p>Stones are arranged to suggest natural permanence and spiritual
                    balance. Some arrangements reflect Buddhist cosmology or Shinto beliefs, while others simply evoke
                    nature. Gravel is often raked in patterns to suggest ripples or waves.</p>
                <h4>Plants</h4>
                <p>vergreen trees such as pine provide year-round structure. Seasonal
                    plants—like cherry blossoms in spring, maples in autumn, and azaleas in early summer—offer contrast
                    and
                    rhythm.
                    Moss is especially prized for its ability to suggest age, quietness, and harmony.</p>
                <h4>Stone lanterns and water basins</h4>
                <p>Both practical and symbolic, bridges often represent a journey or
                    transition — between scenes within the garden or from the physical to the spiritual world.</p>
